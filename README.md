# a_converter — Universal Unit System & Harmonic System

## What is this?

This repository presents the **Universal Unit System (UUS)** and its specific realization, the **Harmonic System**, along with **a_converter** — tools for exploring a unit framework where physical constants and astronomical cycles align with unusually low structural entropy.

**New to this project?** Start here:
- **[Discussion on the UUS and Harmonic System](doc/Discussion_on_the_UUS_and_the_Harmonic_System.md)** — Conceptual overview
- **[Natural Time Scale diagram](doc/pic/NaturalTimeScale.png)** — Visual summary

### A Striking Example

The ratio of **1 year to half-day** can be expressed using only powers of 2 and 3:

$$1 \text{ year} / \text{ half-day } \approx 3^{(+6)} + (3^{(+1)} \cdot 2^{(-1)}) - 2^{(-6)}$$

This matches the tropical year within **~0.2 seconds**.
Such patterns become clearly visible when physical constants are expressed in Base-12.

## Efficiency of Representation: The $\Omega_0$ Convergence

One of the most surprising empirical findings of the Harmonic System is that many macro-scale constants (including those historically used to define the Metric system) can be represented with extreme simplicity:

 $$\text{Constant} \approx \Omega_{0}^{n} \times 12^{m}$$

 - **Parameters:** $n \in \{0, \pm 1\}$ and $m \in \text{integer}$.
 - **Core Constant:** $\Omega_0 = 2$ (formally defined as the **total solid angle of a hypersphere** using the **Gamma function**, see **[doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf), Table 4**).

This pattern holds for diverse values, including the **Earth's meridian length, gravitational acceleration ($g$), water's density, and specific heat** — values historically chosen to define the Metric system. For example, the specific heat of water(4184 J/kg·K) is represented approximately **$\Omega_{0}^{-1} \times 12^{0}$**. While individual alignments might be viewed as coincidental, their collective convergence into this single, low-entropy form suggests that a Base-12 representation can serve a high-resolution **lens** for perceiving aspects of the structural architecture of the Earth-environment system.

*These observations concern **representational efficiency** and numerical structure, providing a novel perspective on the relationship between mathematical systems and physical discovery.*

## Important Notes

- This project does **not** propose a new physical law.
- It does **not** claim that nature "prefers" a specific numeral base.
- It **does** demonstrate that certain mathematical structures become visible when expressed in Base-12 — structures that appear as noise in Base-10.

The Universal Unit System is a **discovery of patterns**, not an invention of new physics.
