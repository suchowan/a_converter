# a_converter — Universal Unit System & Harmonic System

## What is this?

This repository presents the **Universal Unit System (UUS)** and its specific realization, the **Harmonic System**, along with **a_converter** — tools for exploring a unit framework where physical constants and astronomical cycles align with unusually low structural entropy.

**New to this project?** Start here:
- **[Discussion on the UUS and Harmonic System](doc/Discussion_on_the_UUS_and_the_Harmonic_System.md)** — Conceptual overview
- **[Natural Time Scale diagram](doc/pic/NaturalTimeScale.png)** — Visual summary

### A Striking Example

The ratio of **1 year to half-day** can be expressed using only powers of 2 and 3:

$$1 \text{ year} / \text{ half-day } \approx 3^{(+6)} + (3^{(+1)} \cdot 2^{(-1)}) - 2^{(-6)}$$

This matches the tropical year within **~0.2 seconds**.
Such patterns become clearly visible when physical constants are expressed in Base-12.

## Important Notes

- This project does **not** propose a new physical law.
- It does **not** claim that nature "prefers" a specific numeral base.
- It **does** demonstrate that certain mathematical structures become visible when expressed in Base-12 — structures that appear as noise in Base-10.

The Universal Unit System is a **discovery of patterns**, not an invention of new physics.
