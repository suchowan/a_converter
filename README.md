## What is this?

This repository presents the **Universal Unit System (UUS)** and its specific realization, the **Harmonic System**, along with **a_converter** — tools for exploring a unit framework where physical constants and astronomical cycles align with unusually low structural entropy.

**Note:** This system is designed to **coexist with SI**, not replace it—offering a complementary educational perspective.

**New to this project?** Start here:
- **[Discussion on the UUS and Harmonic System](doc/Discussion_on_the_UUS_and_the_Harmonic_System.md)** — Conceptual overview
- **[Natural Time Scale diagram](doc/pic/NaturalTimeScale.png)** — Visual summary

### A Striking Example

The ratio of **1 year to half-day** can be expressed using only powers of 2 and 3:

$$1 \text{ year} / \text{ half-day } \approx 3^{(+6)} + (3^{(+1)} \cdot 2^{(-1)}) - 2^{(-6)}$$

This matches the tropical year within **~0.2 seconds**.
Such patterns become clearly visible when physical constants are expressed in Base-12.

## Efficiency of Representation: The $\Omega_0$ Convergence

One of the most surprising empirical findings of the Harmonic System is that many macro-scale constants (including those historically used to define the Metric system) can be represented with extreme simplicity:

 $$\text{Constant} \approx \Omega_{0}^{n} \times 12^{m}$$

 - **Parameters:** $n \in \{0, \pm 1\}$ and $m \in \text{integer}$.
 - **Core Constant:** $\Omega_0 = 2$ (formally defined as the **total solid angle of a hypersphere** using the **Gamma function**, see **[doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf), Table 4**).

This pattern holds for diverse values, including the **Earth's meridian length, gravitational acceleration ($g$), water's density, and specific heat** — values historically chosen to define the Metric system. For example, the specific heat of water(4184 J/kg·K) is represented approximately **$\Omega_{0}^{-1} \times 12^{0}$**([12‑base numeric form](http://hosi.org/cgi-bin/conv.cgi?m=00090&d=6&fq=1.0000000&frq=10&fe=0&fu=3&tu=0&fp=0&tp=0&fm=off&tm=off&fr=10&tr=12&fl=0&tl=0&c=Convert)).

While individual alignments might be viewed as coincidental, their collective convergence into this single, low-entropy form suggests that a Base-12 representation can serve a high-resolution **lens** for perceiving aspects of the structural architecture of the Earth-environment system.

*These observations concern **representational efficiency** and numerical structure, providing a novel perspective on the relationship between mathematical systems and physical discovery.*

## Cognitive and Practical Affinity

Beyond theoretical efficiency, the Harmonic System exhibits a startling alignment with human culture, historical standards, and the Earth's environment.

### 1. Preserving the Rhythm of Time
One might expect a Base-12 shift to disrupt our sense of time. However, the Harmonic System reveals a profound linguistic and numerical continuity:
- **1 hour = 60 minutes** (Decimal)
- **1 hour = 60; tertias** (Dozenal)

In this system, 1 day is defined as $1000_{12}$ (*one doz gross*) tertias. Consequently, a single hour ($1/24$ day) corresponds exactly to **$60_{12}$** ($72_{10}$) tertias, allowing for a seamless transition in our visual and cognitive representation of time's divisions.

### 2. A Musical Bridge to the Human Scale
The fundamental unit of length, the ***harmon*** (approx. 27.2 cm), bridges the gap between universal constants and human-scale intuition:
- **9 harmons ≈ 8 feet** 

This ratio (**9:8**) corresponds to a **Major Second** in just intonation, echoing the "Harmonic" nature of the system. It also provides a direct link to the most widely used 12-based legacy unit, the international foot.

### 3. Geodetic and Physical Alignment
Just as the Metric system was originally built upon the Earth and water, the Harmonic System "discovers" these anchors at its natural nodes:
- **Earth’s Meridian Quarter≈ $12^7$ ($1000,0000_{12}$)** harmons.
- **Density of Water ≈ $12^2$ ($100_{12}$)** looloh/harmon³.

These alignments suggest that the Earth occupies a "harmonic" position within the Base-12 scaling of the cosmos, making the system highly practical for terrestrial life.

*"Like a navigator using the Big Dipper to find the North, we do not ignore a pattern simply because it might be a 'coincidence.' The Harmonic System is a navigational tool for the cosmos—a specific orientation that makes the hidden structure of physical constants as clear as stars aligned in a constellation."*

## Important Notes

- This project does **not** propose a new physical law.
- It does **not** claim that nature "prefers" a specific numeral base.
- It **does** demonstrate that certain mathematical structures become visible when expressed in Base-12 — structures that appear as noise in Base-10.

The Universal Unit System is a **discovery of patterns**, not an invention of new physics.

## About

**Author:** [Takashi Suga](http://hosi.org/TakashiSuga.rdf) (須賀 隆)  

**History:**
The foundational concepts of this system were first publicly introduced in the July 1984 issue of SF Magazine (Japan), released on May 25, 1984. Over the following four decades, these early insights were refined and formulated into the present Universal Unit System and Harmonic System.
