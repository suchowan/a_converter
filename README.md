a_converter - for dozenal and decimal metric systems
================================================================

Summary of this repository
--------------------------

This repository presents the Universal Unit System (UUS) and its
specific realization: the Harmonic System and a converter for it.

It is a proposal for a unit framework in which physical constants
and astronomical cycles exhibit low-entropy structural alignment.

  Philosophical background: perceiving structure.

This project does not propose a new physical law, nor does it claim
that nature "prefers" a specific numeral base.
