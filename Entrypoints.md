## Entry Points into the Harmonic System  
*This document lists several natural starting points for readers who prefer to begin with a familiar domain before exploring the full harmonic system.*

---

## 1. For readers interested in **physics / atomic constants**  
### **Eq.Ω — Base‑12 compatibility of $e$, $\hbar$, $R_\infty$, $a_B$, $m_e$**  
Historically, the first clue was that the fine‑structure constant satisfies  

  $\alpha \approx 12^{-2}$ .
 
This allows the elementary charge $e$ and the action quantum $\hbar$ to coexist naturally in a dozenal unit system (*1).  
Independently, the Rydberg constant $R_\infty$ and the Bohr radius $a_B$ also fit the same system (*2).  
Because (*1) and (*2) do not interfere dimensionally, the coincidence becomes structurally meaningful, aligning five atomic constants within a common dozenal scaling.

**Relevant:**  
- [doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf) → p.23, equation (15;)  
- [doc/publishedparity1997.pdf](doc/published) → dimensional analysis background
- [doc/harmonic.pdf](doc/harmonic.pdf) → “Dozenal” column (dozenalized physical constants)

## 2. For readers interested in **astronomy / calendars**  
### **Eq.α — Calendar Symmetric Approximation**  
The ratio of the tropical year to the half‑day is extremely close to  

  $3^{+6} + 3^{+1} 2^{-1} - 2^{-6}$ .
 
The deviation is about 9 seconds per year, consistent with *doc/harmonic.pdf*.  
This approximation is the simplest numerical doorway into the system.

**Relevant:**  
- [README.md](README.md#origin-selection-eq%CE%B1--calendar-symmetric-approximation) → “Origin selection (Eq.α)”  
- [doc/harmonic.pdf](doc/harmonic.pdf) → Orange column of the item “Time” (calendar symmetry)
- [doc/pic/NaturalTimeScale.png](doc/pic/NaturalTimeScale.png) → Natural time scale from Planck time to the universe age

## 3. For readers interested in **chemistry / periodic structure**  
### **Universal mol and nucleon alignment**  
Using equation (16;) in *revised.pdf*, nucleon masses fall into a dozenal framework independently of $\alpha$.  
As shown in *atomic.pdf*, the ter‑atomic looloh treats
the atomic masses of all elements as effectively “atomic‑mass‑unit sized” quantities
with sufficient precision for structural use.

Under this combined assumption, the universal mol can be defined exactly as

  $100_{12}{}^{10_{12}} N_{\text{A}}^{-1}$

in dozenal form.

The agreement between the natural distribution of atomic masses and this dozenal
structure is so precise that it appears statistically improbable as a mere coincidence.

**Relevant:**  
- [doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf) → equations (15;) and (16;)  
- [doc/published/parity1997.pdf](doc/published) → Table 6 ( [univunit‑e.pdf](doc/dozenal_com/univunit-e.pdf) )
- [doc/atomic.pdf](doc/atomic.pdf)  → mean and typical atomic weights

---

## 4. For readers interested in **representation / efficiency**  
### **Parity‑based operators (Ω₂)**  
The *parity1997* approach expresses electromagnetic quantities without $\epsilon_0$, using operators such as  

  $e = \sqrt{\alpha \hbar / Z_{\text{P}}}$ .

These operators make the dimensional structure explicit and reduce reliance on conventional electromagnetic constants.

**Relevant:**  
- [doc/publishedparity1997.pdf](doc/published) → operator formulation  
- [doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf)→ structural summary

---

## 5. For readers interested in **the overall structure**  
### **harmonic.pdf**  
The [doc/harmonic.pdf](doc/harmonic.pdf) is a compact overview of how the dozenal framework connects calendar time, atomic constants, and chemical structure.  
This is the recommended “map” once one of the entry points above has been encountered.

# Notes  
- (*1) Compatibility of $e$ and $\hbar$ in dozenal units  
- (*2) Compatibility of $R_\infty$ and $a_B$ in dozenal units  
- These two compatibilities are independent; their coexistence is non‑trivial and leads to the inclusion of $m_e$.
