## Entry Points into the Harmonic System  
*This document lists several natural starting points for readers who prefer to begin with a familiar domain before exploring the full harmonic system.*

---

## 1. For readers interested in **physics / atomic constants**  
### **Eq.Ω — Base‑12 compatibility of $e$, $\hbar$, $R_\infty$, $a_B$, $m_e$**  
Historically, the first clue was that the fine‑structure constant satisfies  

  $\alpha \approx 12^{-2}$ .
 
This allows the elementary charge $e$ and the action quantum $\hbar$ to coexist naturally in a dozenal unit system (*1).  
Independently, the Rydberg constant $R_\infty$ and the Bohr radius $a_B$ also fit the same system (*2).  
Because (*1) and (*2) do not interfere dimensionally, the coincidence becomes structurally meaningful, aligning five atomic constants within a common dozenal scaling.

**Relevant:**  
- [doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf) → p.23, equation (15;)  
- [doc/publishedparity1997.pdf](doc/published) → dimensional analysis background

## 2. For readers interested in **astronomy / calendars**  
### **Eq.α — Calendar Symmetric Approximation**  
The ratio of the tropical year to the half‑day is extremely close to  

  $3^{+6} + 3^{+1} 2^{-1} - 2^{-6}$ .
 
The deviation is about 9 seconds per year, consistent with *doc/harmonic.pdf*.  
This approximation is the simplest numerical doorway into the system.

**Relevant:**  
- [README.md](README.md#origin-selection-eq%CE%B1--calendar-symmetric-approximation) → “Origin selection (Eq.α)”  
- [doc/harmonic.pdf](doc/harmonic.pdf) → Sections on calendar symmetry

## 3. For readers interested in **chemistry / periodic structure**  
### **Universal mol and nucleon alignment**  
Using equation (16;) in *revised.pdf*, nucleon masses fall into a dozenal framework independently of $\alpha$.  
This leads to a “universal mol” of  

  $100_{12}{}^{10_{12}} N_{\text{A}}^{-1}$ ,

which places Carbon‑12 and Iron‑56 on opposite sides of the ter‑atomic looloh.  
The alignment is structurally independent of α, and provides a natural dozenal expression for chemical quantities.  
This coincidence is statistically unlikely.

**Relevant:**  
- [doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf) → equations (15;) and (16;)  
- [doc/publishedparity1997.pdf](doc/published) → Table 6 ( [univunit‑e.pdf](doc/dozenal_com/univunit-e.pdf) )

## 4. For readers interested in **representation / efficiency**  
### **Parity‑based operators (Ω₂)**  
The *parity1997* approach expresses electromagnetic quantities without $\epsilon_0$, using operators such as  

  $e = \sqrt{\alpha \hbar / Z_{\text{P}}}$ .

These operators make the dimensional structure explicit and reduce reliance on conventional electromagnetic constants.

**Relevant:**  
- [doc/publishedparity1997.pdf](doc/published) → operator formulation  
- [doc/revised.pdf](doc/revised.pdf)→ structural summary

---

## 5. For readers interested in **the overall structure**  
### **harmonic.pdf**  
The [doc/harmonic.pdf](doc/harmonic.pdf) is a compact overview of how the dozenal framework connects calendar time, atomic constants, and chemical structure.  
This is the recommended “map” once one of the entry points above has been encountered.

# Notes  
- (*1) Compatibility of $e$ and $\hbar$ in dozenal units  
- (*2) Compatibility of $R_\infty$ and $a_B$ in dozenal units  
- These two compatibilities are independent; their coexistence is non‑trivial and leads to the inclusion of $m_e$.
