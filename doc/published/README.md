This short article presents an early formulation of the idea of *rearranging the dimensions of electromagnetic quantities*.  
Although written long before the Universal Unit System (UUS) was fully developed, it already contains the conceptual seed of  
“dimensional reconfiguration,” which later became a structural pillar of UUS and the Harmonic System.
